description: Connect an MCP-capable coding agent to Cutshort and edit local video projects. Use when the user asks to install, connect, or set up Cutshort; inspect or edit an Cutshort project; work with its timeline, transcript, captions, media, generation, motion graphics, audio, color, or export tools; or recover from an Cutshort MCP error.

# Cutshort

Cutshort is a local-first, agent-native video editor. This skill is the
single external entry point; specialized editing guidance remains inside the
running editor and is loaded on demand with `load_skill`.

## Route the task

- Install, connect, or diagnose the MCP server: read
  `references/getting-started.md`.
- Inspect or modify a project: read `references/editing-workflow.md`.
- Recover from a failed tool call, stale session, or missing editor:
  read `references/known-errors.md`.

## Essentials

1. Start Cutshort before connecting. The default MCP endpoint is
   `http://localhost:5199/api/external-mcp/mcp`.
2. Call `cutshort_status`, then `list_projects`. Select a project only when
   the user names it or the current context identifies it.
3. Call `load_skill` before specialized work. It is read-only and requires
   neither `begin_edit_session` nor `editSessionId`; available names and support
   files come from the live MCP tool description.
   With progressive exposure enabled, this call reveals the skill's referenced
   tools and emits `tools/list_changed`; refresh the list before continuing.
4. Before project reads or edits, call `begin_edit_session`. Keep its
   `editSessionId` and pass it to every draft-safe editor tool.
5. Set `reuseExisting: true` on `begin_edit_session` to reuse your active draft
   or adopt an unchanged orphan. Existing operations and approval mode are kept.
   If reuse is rejected, call `list_edit_sessions`. Use `recover_edit_session`
   only with a listed `recoveryActions` value; another online owner must finish
   or discard its own session.
6. Use `approvalMode: "manual"` unless the user explicitly asks for unattended
   application. In manual mode, the user approves the complete proposal in
   Cutshort. In auto mode, `review_edit_session` applies the complete draft.
7. Finish with `review_edit_session`. Report success only after
   `get_edit_session` returns `applied`.
